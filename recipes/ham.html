    <h1>Honey Glazed Ham</h1>
    <p>This ham tastes very much like the famous honey baked ham but costs much less,</p>

    <h3>Honey-Glazed Ham Ingredients</h3>
    <p>You'll need just five ingredients for this top-rated honey-glazed ham recipe:</p>

    <h4><strong>Ham</strong></h4>
    <p>This recipe calls for one 5-pound ready-to-eat ham. If your ham is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.</p>
    
    <h4><strong>cloves</strong></h4>
    <p>Aromatic whole cloves add warm, spicy-sweet flavor.</p>
    
    <h4><strong>Honey</strong></h4>
    <p>Of course, you'll need honey. Pro-tip: Spray your measuring cup with cooking spray so the honey slides out easily.</p>
    
    <h4><strong>Corn syrup</strong></h4>
    <p>Dark corn syrup adds more flavor and contributes to caramelization. Some reviewers suggest substituting brown sugar or using a combination of corn syrup and brown sugar.</p>
    
    <h4><strong>Butter</strong></h4>
    <p>Butter adds and helps retain moisture, resulting in a juicy honey-baked ham that's impossible to resist.</p>
