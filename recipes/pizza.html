    <img src="../images/pizza.webp" alt="pizza">
    <p>If you refrain from grain, but can't go without pizza...you've got to try this version with a 1-ingredient crust made just from cheese</p>
    <h3><b>Ingredients</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Â½ cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>

        <li>5 cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons torn fresh basil leaves</li>

        <li>4 small fresh mozzarella balls (bocconcini), thinly sliced</li>
        </ul>
    <h3><b>Directions</b></h3>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Step 1</b></li>
    <p>Heat a 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly into hot skillet;</p>
    <p>cook until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>

    <li><b>Step 2</b></li>
    <p>Arrange tomato slices, basil leaves, and fresh mozzarella slices on the melted cheese, leaving space for a "crust" to form;</p>

    <li><b>Step 3</b></li>
    <p>Remove skillet from heat and loosen pizza with a spatula. Gently slice pizza onto a cutting board; cool for 1 minute before slicing.</p>
